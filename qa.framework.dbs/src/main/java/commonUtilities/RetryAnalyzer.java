 * Retry Analyzer is considered as a best practice for handling test failure in case of any odd circumstances occurred by system

 * To handle that we have use retry analyzer which is responsible for smooth run.
 * 
 * For our framework we have used the same with a counter of 3 as a maximum limit, in this case if a test fails then it will re-execute
 * the same for a maximum of three times if the test is passed in any of the three run it will be considered as pass it will stop 
 * executing it further.
